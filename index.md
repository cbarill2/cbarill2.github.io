Hi! My name is Chris Barill, and I am an aspiring game developer. I know you're short on time, so go ahead and follow the [Personal Projects][] link to see what I've been working on. Then, if you like what you see, head back here to learn a little more about me!

I've been playing games for most of my life and programming for the past few years. I currently work as an "Implementation Consultant" on tax administration software. It's as incredibly exciting as it sounds...

Before I learned to write my first "Hello World!" in high school, I thought making games was a mystical, voodoo-like, dark arts process that I'd never be able to learn on my own. Back then, there were no Game Design schools, so I decided to attend my local university, West Virgina University (WVU), and study Computer Science, with the hope of one day being able to make video games. It took a few years after high school to get there, but I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2013.

After graduating, life circumstances pushed me into taking the first job I could get--Software Consultant--rather than the job I wanted--Game Designer. Now, after years in unfulfilling jobs, I am able to work toward my original goal, with one major difference: instead of designing games, I want to program them. One of the most important things I learned in college is that I truly love programming, as much as I've always loved games.
