Hello! My name is Chris Barill, and I am a Software Engineer aspiring to be a Gameplay Engineer. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from West Virginia University.

## Game Projects

### Digital Tabletop RPG, For Kids (C++, SFML)
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/cbarill2/SimpleDungeonGame)

My current project is a tile-based, turn-based RPG with simple mechanics to introduce kids to tabletop gaming. It will feature a procedurally generated game board with monsters to defeat, prisoners to rescue, and treasure to collect.

Re-creation of _Pong_ with a bouncing ball and 2 opposing paddles, which can be moved independently using one keyboard (W and S to move the left paddle and the Up and Down arrow keys to move the right paddle).

### 3D Project (Java, LWJGL)

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/bourdain-industries/LearningLWJGL)

Basic 3D space with a first-person camera. There is also some code for procedural generation of a simple 2D action-adventure dungeon (from before I switched it to 3D).

### Log Dodger (Python, PyGame)

My first game project: a simple arcade game, built for Intro to Game Design in college. You play as a treasure hunter trying to climb a hill while monkeys roll logs down the hill to impede you. Dodge the logs by moving left or right, but you never progress up the hill.
