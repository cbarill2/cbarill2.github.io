### Game Design Influences

#### Video Games

I've been playing games for most of my life, beginning with [_Super Mario Bros._](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) and [_Duck Hunt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) on the NES. I fell in love with RPGs like [_Final Fantasy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)) and [_Dragon Warrior_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)), and my first open world game [_The Legend of Zelda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)).

On Sega Genesis, I played lots of [_Mutant League Football_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football), [_Beyond Oasis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Oasis), [_Phantasy Star IV_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star_IV), and my first tactical RPG, [_Warsong_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langrisser:_The_Descendants_of_Light).

On Nintendo 64, [_GoldenEye 007_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_video_game)) held most of my time and attention, but I also played [_The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time), the very unique [_Blast Corps_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_Corps), and my favorite platformer of all time, [_Conker's Bad Fur Day_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conker%27s_Bad_Fur_Day).

On PlayStation, I played many more RPGs, including [_Final Fantasy VII_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII), [_VIII_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII), and [_IX_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IX), as well as some of my favorite tactical RPGs, [_Final Fantasy Tactics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics), [_Tactics Ogre_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactics_Ogre:_Let_Us_Cling_Together), and [_Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigandine_(video_game)).

#### Tabletop Games

My aunt brought home the _Dungeons & Dragons_ ["black box"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1991_revision) when I was around ten years old and acted as Dungeon Master (DM) for my sister and I. She continued to run adventures for us in [_Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&_Dragons_2nd_Edition) and [_Palladium_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_Fantasy_Role-Playing_Game). Around this time, she also introduced me to [_Magic: The Gathering_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering), which I continued to play off-and-on for a number of years.

In high school, I was DM for a weekly [_Dungeons & Dragons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_&_Dragons_3rd_edition) game for which I created my own adventures, often improvising an entire session.

### Programming

Before I wrote my first "Hello World!" in high school, I thought making games was a mystical, voodoo-like, dark arts process that I'd never be able to learn on my own.

Back then, Game Design schools were less prevalent, so I decided to attend my local college, West Virginia University (WVU), to study Computer Science, with the goal of leveraging my programming skills to become a Game Designer. It took a few years after high school to get there, but I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics, in 2013.

After graduating, life circumstances pushed me into taking the first job I could get--Software Consultant--rather than the job I wanted--Game Developer. Now, after six years in unfulfilling jobs, I am determined to achieve my original goal, with one major difference: instead of designing games, I want to program them. One of the most important things I have learned since college is that I truly love programming, as much as I've always loved playing games.
